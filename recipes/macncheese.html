    <h2>Macaroni and Cheese:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup salted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bread Crumb Topping:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>  
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2><u>Step-1:</u></h2>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
        </p>
        <h2><u>Step-2:</u></h2>
        <p>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-3:</u></h2>
        <p>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-4:</u></h2>
        <p>Gradually whisk in the milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, until the mixture is smooth. Stir in the cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-5:</u></h2>
        <p>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-6:</u></h2>
        <p>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-7:</u></h2>
        <p>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-8:</u></h2>
        <p>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</p>
        <h2><u>Step-9:</u></h2>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
